qwerty 0.1
==========

A small text-editor, clone of GNU nano

Why nano? Well, it's simple, lightweight and gets the job done.
Why clone it? It's fun, so.

Setup
=====

Well, it's simple to setup, really.
Just run

```
:$ make
```

from your terminal. You'll find the
program in the bin folder that this
came with.

Dependencies
============

qwerty needs no external C libraries in
order to compile & run. This means that
it will run pretty much on any vanilla *nix box!
